Here you will find my analysis on multiple data sets. I follow the same method for each project.


Opperation Procedure:
1.  Ask.  
2.  Prepare. 
3.  Process  
4.  Analyze
5.  Share 
6.  Act 

Problem Types:
- Making Predictions

I currnetly use R & Python for statistical analysis and tableu for visualizations. 

Any feed back is greatly appreciated!
